        <h2>About RibEye3 Modifier</h2>
        <p>This project started as a "what-if" question: What if we could update our favourite game, R.B.I. Baseball
        3, with a 2013 roster? </p>

        <p>Then we asked ourselves, how would a handful of CompSci and Engineering graduates approach the problem?</p>

        <p><i>Then</i> we asked ourselves, why not build something that lets anyone create R.B.I. Baseball 3
            game files?</p>

        <p>We hit the search engines and found an extensive R.B.I. Baseball hacking community - most of it focused
            on the original RBI Baseball - and a handful of really neat mods for RBI 3.
            We started this project in November 2013. Look where we are now!</p>

        <p>Please note! We <b>don't</b> host ROMs on this site - you must supply their own
            copy of the original R.B.I. Baseball 3, which is then patched to your liking. After you download your
            modified file, it is deleted from the server. </p>

        <h2>Help</h2>
        <p>If something is not working as you expect, please submit an issue to our

            be as detailed as possible, and we'll take a look at it. We love classic RBI Baseball as much as you
            do, and we want this to work! </p>
