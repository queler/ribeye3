        <h2>About RibEye3 Modifier</h2>
        <p>This project started as a "what-if" question: What if we could update our favourite game, R.B.I. Baseball
        3, with a 2013 roster? </p>

        <p>Then we asked ourselves, what if we could let anyone create their own rosters in R.B.I. Baseball 3?</p>

        <p>We started Googling and found an extensive R.B.I. Baseball hacking community, but little effort has been
        put into 3 (arguably the best of the series). So we started working in November 2013. Look where we are now!</p>

        <p>Please note! We <b>don't</b> host ROMs on this site - users must supply their own
            copy of the original RBI Baseball 3, which is then patched to their liking. Newly created ROM files are
            deleted off the server within minutes. </p>

        <h2>Help</h2>
        <p>If something's not working as you expect, please submit an issue in our
            <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ribeye3-modifier/issues/list">Google Code issue tracker</a>. Please
            be as detailed as possible, and we'll take a look at it. We love classic RBI Baseball as much as you
            do, and we want this to work! </p>
